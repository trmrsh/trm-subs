'trm.subs' is a Python module that provides a few generally useful utilities 
that are sometimes required by other modules. I only support python3.X now.

Installation:

As well as standard Python, you will need 'numpy', 'scipy' and my C++ subs 
package. Once these are installed, install with:

pip install . --user

to install in default location for a single user. Look at 'pip' for more options.
